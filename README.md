# predictive-maintanace-based-machine-learnning-for-automated-tubular-cleaing-system

the models file consist of machine learning models and the necesarry data. 

The Apply.ipynb is file to demo the best machine learning which is the rsf_model

The rsf_model.sav is the model weight after trained

The real_time.py is pyhton code that expected to be used on raspberry pi to be connected to arduino ( as the tubular cleaning machine model use arduino) 
and data from sensor are serial transfered from arduino to raspberry pi
